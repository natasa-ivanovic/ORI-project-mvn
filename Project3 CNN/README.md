To start the project, open the finalCNN.py file (preferably in IDE like PyCharm).  
Before running anything make a folder named chest_xray_data_set if you wish to try to
train the model and paste the training images inside.  
If you want to evaluate the network on the newest dataset make a folder named chest-xray-dataset-test
and paste the images inside.  
You can get the train data <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EoKNe24GDssnVjbps6wLWqMP2eODMqSg">here</a> and the test data <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1amr0Bn3ESNUeIcLkjLOV4KcgfBNRts3Q/view?usp=sharing">here.</a>    
Keep training on false if you want to test on the newest dataset.  
If you wish to train the network first delete .json and .h5 files with the same name as the python file.
