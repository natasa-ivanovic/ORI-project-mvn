To start the project, open the main.py file (preferably in an IDE like PyCharm).  
Inside you will find instructions in the comments on what you can change, but you can run it out of the gate to just do the clustering, without any visualization.  
Uncomment line #140 for number of clusters chart and data.  
Change arguments plot and pca in line #152 for 2D visualization.  
Inside the folders pokusaj 1 and pokusaj 2 you can find details about the clusters achieved there.  
The summary and analysis of the results we achieved is located in the Results folder inside the root of the repository.
